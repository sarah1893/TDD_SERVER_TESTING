# Summary

In this lesson we covered a set of technologies used for testing a Node server. These included:

- *Chai* - a library for extending the built in Node assertion library
- *jsdom* - a library for interacting and testing the DOM returned by the server (this functionality is encapsulated in our ``parseTextFromHTML`` helper function).
- *async / await* - a pattern for making asynchronous code more readable
- *SuperTest* - a library for making Node server requests and testing their responses

## Instructions

1. In the pane to the right there is a test that makes use of all the technologies. Run the test using npm test and verify it passes. In the next lesson, weâ€™ll use these concepts to further explore testing a Node server.

When you are ready to move on, check your work.

> Hint
> Type **``npm test``** in the terminal and press enter
